# Beyond AI SDK - End-to-End Tests

This directory contains comprehensive end-to-end tests for the Beyond AI SDK that test the SDK as it would be consumed by end users via npm install.

## Test Structure

- `test-sdk-dev.js` - Tests against the development API environment
- `test-sdk-prod.js` - Tests against the production API environment
- `package.json` - Test dependencies and scripts

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have access to the Beyond AI GitHub npm registry
2. **Create `.npmrc`** in the repository root (if it doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   echo "@Beyond-Network-AI:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com" > ../.npmrc
   npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@Beyond-Network-AI
   ```
   This file stores your GitHub authentication token and is gitignored.
3. **Copy `.npmrc`** from the root directory to this folder:
   ```bash
   cp ../.npmrc .
   ```
4. Have a valid email address for testing OTP functionality

## Running Tests

### Quick Tests

```bash
# Test latest version against dev environment
npm run test:dev

# Test latest version against prod environment  
npm run test:prod

# Install latest version and test dev
npm run test:latest
```

### Testing Specific Versions

```bash
# Test a specific version (e.g., 0.1.4)
npm install @Beyond-Network-AI/beyond-ai@0.1.4
npm run test:dev

# Or use the helper (if implemented)
npm run test:specific --version=0.1.4
```

### Clean Up

```bash
# Remove all test artifacts
npm run clean
```

## Test Coverage

Each test covers:

1. **SDK Import** - Verifies the package can be imported correctly
2. **Initialization** - Tests SDK configuration and setup
3. **Authentication Status** - Checks initial auth state
4. **OTP Request** - Tests email OTP request functionality
5. **OTP Verification** - Tests login with OTP
6. **Authentication Verification** - Confirms login state
7. **Storage Functionality** - Tests token storage and retrieval
8. **Sign Out** - Tests logout and cleanup

## Test Environments

### Development Environment
- API URL: `https://dev-api.beyondnetwork.xyz`
- Debug mode: Enabled
- Storage prefix: `beyond_e2e_`

### Production Environment  
- API URL: `https://api.beyondnetwork.xyz`
- Debug mode: Disabled
- Storage prefix: `beyond_e2e_prod_`

## Interactive Testing

Both tests are interactive and will prompt for:
- Email address for OTP
- OTP code received via email
- Confirmation for sign out

## Expected Output

Successful test run should show:
```
âœ… SDK imported successfully
âœ… SDK initialized successfully
âœ… OTP request successful
âœ… Login successful!
âœ… Authentication state verified
âœ… Storage functionality verified
âœ… Successfully signed out
âœ… Sign out verified
ðŸŽ‰ E2E Test completed!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module not found errors** - Ensure the SDK version is published and accessible
2. **Registry access errors** - Make sure `.npmrc` is copied from root directory
3. **API connection errors** - Check network connectivity and API endpoints
4. **OTP failures** - Verify email delivery and correct OTP entry
5. **Authentication errors** - Check API credentials and user permissions

### Debug Mode

For development testing, debug mode is enabled and will show:
- Detailed API request/response logs
- SDK configuration details
- Storage operations

## Integration with Main Repository

These tests can be run from the main repository using the npm scripts defined in the root `package.json`.
